# SinhalaOombi

This repository contains the original source of the Sinhala Oombi game for Windows. 

## History
This was written back in 2007/8 while I was waiting for the university admission. I was still learning C/C++ and then I found this 
classic book on Windows Programming, "Programming Windows" by Charles Petzold. http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/index.html 
The book has been a great inspiration and "SinhalaOombi" has started even before finishing it. 

## Compiling 
The original source was compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2001. 

## Todo
* Convert the project into CMake based build system.
