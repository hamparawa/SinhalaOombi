01)	Intro.
	
	First of all letme apologize for making this Readme in English,
	I gave up the idea of a Sinhala Readme because it is very much hard
	to maintain...

	Well, As you can see Oombi_Sinhala is a game to play Oombi,
	which is very famous among SriLankans( esp. in Funeral Houses ).
	I don't know where this game came from, or if there is any other
	PC game to play this,but when I saw HEARTS in Windows, I thought 
	'Why shouldn't I make something like that?'


02)	Requirements.
	
	Oombi_Sinhala doesn't need Hardware Acceleration or Direct 3D :)
	but it needs Windows XP / 2000 or Vista.
	In Windows 98, The Sinhala Font cannot be loaded, so Win98 is 
	not supported...
	

03)	How To..???
	
	*   When asked for trumps, click the sign to select trumps.

	*   Just Click a card to play. If you can't play that card there 
	    will be a sound notifying you.

	*   You can select a new game from the Game Menu or press 'F2'.
	
	*   To Quickly Minimize, press 'Escape' key.
	
	*   To Show Help, press 'F1'.
	
	*   To Show the last hand, press 'F4'. 
	

04)	FAQ.

	Q)  I don't know how to play Oombi?
	A)  Well, I'm sorry. This readme is not for it. You have to learn 
	    it from someone else, and you SHOULD, because its a very famous
	    card game among SriLankans.


	Q)  Do I need to install Sinhala Fonts in my system to play this?
	A)  No.. You don't have to install Sinhala Fonts to play...


	Q)  Sometimes, When moving cards, the cards aren't displayed correctly,
	    they seem to disappear & come back again?
	A)  This happens, if your computer is a slow machine, or you are
	    out of system resources. If it happens, close any other programs
	    that runs in the background & try play it again.


	Q)  I have found a serious BUG!!!, & I like to report it to you for make
	    Oombi_Sinhala better?
	A)  Well, thank you in advance..Your help is much appreciated..
	    You can find my mail address @ the end of this document.
	    

05)	Special Thanks.

	A big thank you goes out to my friend Sanjeewa Madushanka who supplied
	the Card back cover image & Compatibility check in Windows Vista.
	
	I have taken the CardPack & the Sounds from the Solitare & Hearts in
	Windows, I hope Bill Gates wouldn't mind that:)
	
	Thanks to everyone Who helped me & willing to help me in this...


06)	Outrooooo....

	restrictions... But it's not for any commercial use..
